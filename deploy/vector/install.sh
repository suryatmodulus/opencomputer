# install.sh — Install Vector on a host and wire it to a role-specific config.
#
# Usage (run as root on the target host):
#   ./install.sh worker         # for prod worker VMs (reads journald)
#   ./install.sh control-plane  # for prod control plane VM (reads journald)
#   ./install.sh dev-host       # single VM running both server + worker as systemd
#
# Two ways the env file (with the Axiom token) reaches the host:
#
#   1. Production (Azure VMs with managed identity to KV): populate-vector-env.service
#      is installed alongside vector.service. At each boot it fetches the
#      `shared-axiom-platform-ingest-token` secret from $SECRETS_VAULT_NAME and
#      writes /etc/opensandbox/vector.env. Vector starts after. No human in the
#      loop, no static token on disk.
#
#   2. Operator-managed (dev hosts, ad-hoc): the operator writes
#      /etc/opensandbox/vector.env manually before running this script (or any
#      other way). The KV oneshot finds no SECRETS_VAULT_NAME and exits clean,
#      and Vector reads whatever the operator put there.
