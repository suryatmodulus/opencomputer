# populate-vector-env-wait.sh — Background poller that waits for cloud-init
# to write /etc/opensandbox/worker.env (or server.env), then re-runs the
# main populator to fetch real Axiom creds from Key Vault and restarts
# vector.service so it picks them up.
#
# Started imperatively by populate-vector-env.sh when neither worker.env
# nor server.env exists at populator-run time (Azure first-boot race —
# cloud-final.service writes worker.env *after* multi-user.target, so the
# main populator can't synchronously wait for it without deadlocking the
# boot).
#
# Not WantedBy=multi-user.target — boot doesn't wait on this. Runs as a
# long-lived Type=simple service so systemd tracks it cleanly and the
# logs land in journald under populate-vector-env-wait.service.
