	// as well as to bucket edges, so boundary buckets report only the
	// fraction that overlaps the original window — the contract is
	// [from, to), not "the union of minutes touching [from, to)".
	//
	// Allocation source is sandbox_scale_events (same table the billing
	// aggregator reads). Open events (ended_at IS NULL) are clamped to
	// LEAST(now(), $4) to match GetOrgUsage's COALESCE idiom — so the
	// two endpoints agree exactly when ended_at IS NULL. They diverge
	// when ended_at > to: the aggregator overshoots (inherited quirk;
	// see internal/db/usage_query.go:durationExpr), the new endpoint
	// clamps to $4. This divergence is intentional and tested.
	//
	// Uptime per bucket = SUM(overlap_seconds) across joined events.
	// This makes uptime track "was a scale event open" rather than
	// "did we receive a sample," so collector outages don't masquerade
	// as downtime in the response.
	//
	// Used memory: AVG/MAX over samples that fall in the bucket. At
	// the 60s collector cadence there is usually one sample per
	// bucket; the aggregates absorb the rare clock-skew duplicate.
